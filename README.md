TiRiFiG
============

|PyPI Version|

TiRiFiC is a 3D kinematic modelling tool used to model resolved spectroscopic
observations of rotating discs in terms of the tilted-ring model with varying complexity.
The front-end (TiRiFiG, Tilted-Ring-Fitting-GUI), part of the toolkit, is an aid to
enable the user to perform the modelling process interactively. We present the current
implementation.
