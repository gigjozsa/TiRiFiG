    "\n",
    "### Spelling Style\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we all come from different backgrounds on our spelling stylea we need to formalize the text on one style, we will use the [MNRAS style](http://www.oxfordjournals.org/our_journals/mnras/for_authors/#6.2 Spelling, grammar, punctuation and mathematics) which is essentially British English spelling, e.g. colour instead of color, but uses 'z' in most '-ize' ending words. The specific direction taken from the MNRAS style guide:\n",
    "\n",
    "> ##### Punctuation \n",
    "> Hyphens (one dash in LaTeX) should be used for compound adjectives (e.g. low-density gas, least-squares fit, two-component model). This also applies to simple adjectival units (e.g. 1.5-m telescope, 284.5-nm line), but not to complex units or ranges, which could become cumbersome (e.g. 15 km s–1 feature, 100–200 µm observations). Some words (e.g. time-scale) are always hyphenated as part of journal style (see below). \n",
    "> \n",
    "> N-rules (two dashes in LaTeX): these are longer than hyphens and are used (i) to separate key words, (ii) as parentheses (e.g. the results – assuming no temperature gradient – are indicative of …), (iii) to denote a range (e.g. 1.6–2.2 µm), and (iv) to denote the joining of two words (e.g. Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, Herbig–Haro object). \n",
    "> \n",
    "> M-rules (three dashes in TeX/LaTeX) are not used in MNRAS.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> ##### Spelling and grammar \n",
    "> Please use British English spellings – e.g. centre not center, labelled not labeled. For words ending in -ise/yse or -ize follow this style: use -ise/yse for devise, surprise, comprise, revise, exercise, analyse; use -ize for recognize, criticize, minimize, emphasize, organize, ionize, polarize, parametrize (note the spelling of this word in particular). \n",
    "> \n",
    "> ‘None’ is a singular word (none of the stars is a white dwarf), whilst ‘data’ is a plural word (these data show…). \n",
    "> \n",
    "> Miscellaneous journal spellings: acknowledgements, artefact, best-fitting (not best-fit), disc (except computer disk), haloes (not halos), hotspot, none the less, non-linear, on to, time-scale. \n",
    "> \n",
    "> For any other spellings, use whichever version is listed first in the Oxford English Dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Figures, Equations, and Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "When referencing a figure, equation, or table in the text use Fig. [Number], Eq. [Number], Table [Number].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section Referencing\n",
    "\n",
    "When referencing a section in the text use the $\\S$ symbol using the notation `$\\S$ [section number]`, e.g. $\\S$ 4.3.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Editor/Author Collaboration\n",
    "\n",
    "We leave it to the editors and authors on how best to collaborate on incorporating edits and comments into the text. A suggestion is for the editor to send a pull request to the author's github fork. Once the edits are worked out, the author will then do a pull request to the main github repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Editing Attribution\n",
    "\n",
    "At the introduction of each chapter there is a list of chapter writers and editors. Please add your name to the editor's list, include the particular section number which you edited. We need this so we can keep track of who knows about each section. And, we want to give you recognition for your work."
