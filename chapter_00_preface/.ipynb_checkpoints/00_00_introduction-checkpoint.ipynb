The directory will contain notebooks, a `ii_figures` file containing figures (ii being the chapter number),  a ii_bibtex.bib file containing bibtex entries. Any data or additional files will be in a seperate data directory. Notice that very large data should not be stored in a github repository. They should be stored at another place, then the students be instructed to download the data into the data directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook naming should be prefixed with the chapter number (two digits) and a sequential number (two digits) based on ordering in the chapter. Like directories, the notebook name should be the section name (with underscores to replace spaces), a shortened version of the section is also fine, e.g. the Sky Model section of Chapter 6 would be `06_01_sky_models.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notebook Breadth:\n",
    "\n",
    "Each chapter is made up of multiple sections, each of which is possibly made up of sub-section, et cetera.

For example a table in the Imaging chapter which contains information on weights could have the label `imaging:tbl:weights`. The `chapterStr` for each chapter is to be defined by the authors. If a section of a chapter is sufficiently large it shoud have its own `chapterStr`, perhaps with the prefix including the chapter `chapterStr`. The following are valid strings for `type`: `tbl` (table), `fig` (figure), `sec` (section), `code` (code block), `eq` (equation). The `uniqueID` is left to the authors, but suggested to contain a simple descriptive string and information on location within the chapter.\n",
